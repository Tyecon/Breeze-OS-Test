# Breeze-OS-Test

After discussing with friends on how making an operating system today compared to when Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds made Windows and Linux would be much different, I built a simple operating system based on Unix using x86_64 assembly and C. I used a GCC cross compiler, Oracle's VirtualBox, and GNU Grub Bootloader to run/test it. Features command line input, 64 bit paging memory access, interrupt handling, device drivers. It was just a learning experience, and I stopped working on it after having trouble with the global descriptor tables.
