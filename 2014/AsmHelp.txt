CPU DRIVER:
CPU's start in real mode (16bit) by default, this allows you to access 1MB+64KB-16B of memory
To turn CPU into protected mode (32bit)

Registers - Memory that is faster then even the RAM, however there is a limited number of registers with small amounts of space.
Segment:Offset=Segmentx16+Offset

RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX - Main 64 bit registers for general use
R8 through R15 - New extra registers for 64 bit only
EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX - Main 32 bit registers for general use
AX/BX/CX/DX - Main 16 bit registers for general use; Can be 8 bit AX=AH and AL

CS - Code Segment
DS - Data Segment
ES - Extra Segment

GS
SS - Stack Segment
GDT - Register that stores information about other registers
The GDT register is 48 bits long, 16 bits for size then 32 bits of location in memory
lgdt [gdtr] will load the gdt
